This app is rewritten using the Flutter framework.

## Why using this app?

The main concept of this app is not to recreate something that works, instead to create an app that "overrides" the stock one, with a much more modern ui and performance improvements.

## What are the implemented features?

- [x] Reads the previously created servers.
- [x] Reads installed tracks (Not completely implemented, some errors in stock tracks with layouts).
- [ ] Reads the installed cars.
- [ ] Saves the changes.
- [ ] Creates new servers (not quite there yet).
- [ ] Selects the server that can be started from the .bat file.
